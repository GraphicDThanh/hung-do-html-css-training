            A paragraph consists of one or more sentences that form a self-contained
            unit of discourse. The start of a paragraph is indicated by a new line.

            Text is easier to understand when it is split up into units of text. For
            example, a book may have chapters. Chapters can have subheadings. Under
            each heading there will be one or more paragraphs

          Molly had been staring out of her window for about
          an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies
          of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all
          the other scientific journals her work had
          appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On
          The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book
          since college, and the longer she spent in these
          four walls the more she felt she needed to be
          free.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
          She had spent the last ten years in this room,
          sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote
          proclaiming that
          <q>
            Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do
          </q>. 
          Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling 	the secrets of the llama 
          <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">
            DNA
          </abbr>
          , to be an outstanding achievement, Molly 
          <em>did</em> 
          think she had something better to do.
