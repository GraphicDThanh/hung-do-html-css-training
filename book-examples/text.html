		<h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
		<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
		<p>
			Molly had been staring out of her window for about
			an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies
			of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all
			the other scientific journals her work had
			appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On
			The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book
			since college, and the longer she spent in these
			four walls the more she felt she needed to be
			free.
		</p>
		<p>
			She had spent the last ten years in this room,
			sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote
			proclaiming that 
			<q>
				Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do
			</q>. 
			Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling 	the secrets of the llama 
			<abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">
				DNA
			</abbr>
			, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly 
			<em>did</em> 
			think she had something better to do.
